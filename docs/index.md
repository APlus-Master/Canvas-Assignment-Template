# Overview

There are lots of video interface standards! A PC technician needs to recognize the cables and connectors that go with them -- including the old ones -- and have a working understanding of the pros and cons of each.

For this assignment you'll research one of the common video interfaces with a small group (two or three people) and create a one-page "data sheet" with essential information about the interface -- information that would help a PC technician to decide which interface is apprpriate for a situation, and to help them recognize the interfaces that they encounter in the field.
